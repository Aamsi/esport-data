Getting data from PandaScore to maybe make something with it one day :)

https://pandascore.co/

Hello!

I love esports, and I've always wanted to do some stuff with it. 

Now that I know a bit of python, and that we all have to stay home (COVID and stuff), I decided to make something!

I don't know what yet... ¯\(°_o)/¯

For now, I'm just getting datas and ordering it to manipulate it later.

See you guys!
